            <h2>God I Love This Manga So Much</h2>
            <p>Where do I even begin? The breathtaking art? The characters? The worldbuilding? The fact that the main thesis centers around disability and learning and gatekeeping knowledge and the consequences of that? The fact that its a witch story that actually touches on the consequences of if only one part of society is able to do magic? [less serious point]?
            <p>This series has taken over my life since I started reading it in November 2020 and I have zero regrets. I am mostly up to date with collecting the physical volumes. They are my most prized possession. Every update is like a mini holiday to me.</p>
            <p>The plot summary is that a ~12 year old girl, Coco, has always wanted to be a witch but since she wasn't born a witch she can't do magic. That is, at least, until she meets Qifrey, a witch. Coco ends up spying on him and learns that instead of having to be born with the ability to do magic you just have to draw glyphs. She ends up trying a few spells from a book she got as a child that she was promised was a magic book with a 'wand' (special ink pen). Turns out this was a bad idea as one of them ends up turning her mother into stone/crystal and Qifrey only just managed to save her in time. Qifrey ends up taking her under his wing as an apprentice among 3 others (mostly for personal gain at the time but it goes beyond that). Through the series we learn about how witch society works. How theres a pact of secrecy that forbids non-witches from learning how to do magic. The main antagonist group called the brimhats that want everyone to learn how to do magic and think that no magic should be forbidden. How disability affects people. Shit gets dark at times and its wonderful (BODY HORROR IN TWO CASES ESPECIALLY).</p>
            <p>I 100% agree with the motivation of the brimhats btw they are absolutely in the right their methods of mainipulating people however not so much.</p>
