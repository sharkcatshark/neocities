- PCs: The Antithesis To Capitalist Gaming
- Linux Is A Good Example Of Innovation Without Monetary Incentive
    - open source software is vital
    - subscription based models need to fucking stop
    - the goal of products should be to improve peoples lives in one way or another, not to make a profit. when people are focused on helping others tahts how innovation occurs because you adapt to new people porblems. with profit you only care about catering to the top 1% (the people who are essentially financing your life if you go aginst them, the profit goes away)
    - foss is or should be the future of software
- Get An RSS Reader
- Piracy Is Cool
    - the rise of streaming services and the fall of phyiscal media and the subsequent fall of streaming services and rise of piracy
    - if you buy game you should own that game not just be "renting" it till the site you bought it from shuts down (drm bad)
    - information should be freely shared and paywalls help restrict that so we need to abolish paywalls
    - copyright bad. patents bad. boo trademarks: we are at a point in society where you can trademark colours, speech, words, basic features. this only limits others ability to create shit and just results in the rich getting richer

- AI, NFT, Cryptocurrency. The Overengineering and overreliance on technology for trends
    - Fuck AI Actually
    - take it out of art
    - we cant have ai taking over jobs when people need those jobs to survive. its either get rid of the ai or introduce a universal basic income or 15 hour work weeks
    - nfts are shit. cryptocurrency is shit
    - overreliance on technology for everything
    - i dont like natural language processing with ai :D
    - to quote jurassic park: "Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should
    - tech ecosystems and its consequences (apple)
    - tech monopolies are bad (amazon, aws)
    - things that require wifi but really shouldnt
    - the cloud is scary and self-hosting will always be better
    - smarthomes bad

<!-- politics -->
<!--
- I Long For The Abolition Of The British Monarchy
- I Will Never Understand How A Lot Of Working Class People Have Zero Class Consciousness (its a refusal to realise that the system we live in is fundamentally broken and that change is possible)
- why do i have to kill myself to survive
    - When I say "Fuck Monetisation" I don't mean that people shouldn't recieve money for their labour I'm moreso talking about the exploitative way our society is built that results in people being extorted in the name of profits. For example: Microtransactions. Microtransactions are shit.
    - we should not be trying to montetise everything/human existence
