            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>I want this site to be my little corner of the internet away from all the bullshit of the normal web. I want to structure the content on here the way that <em>I</em> want to. I don't want to be at the mercy of whatever fucking CEO. I don't want to use whatever trendy mini-site carrd clone is popular. I don't want to see AI shit everytime I just want to look at someone's profile. I want to be free from the confines of capitalism and its griphold of modern day social media. I am tired.</p>
                <p>I first created this site so that I could dabble around with web development but also because I strongly agreed with and related to the general philosophy of the Neocities community. I love web revival and everything it stands for. I wasn't alive during the late 90s early 2000s internet but we lost so much customisability and general fun with the birth of social media. I'm truly mourning something I never experienced. Club Penguin was the closest thing I got to that experience.</p>
                <p>I'll admit that I do still use some social media (mainly Tumblr) with the addition of Discord and Instagram for communication mainly because if I didn't I would have zero friends because that's what everyone uses and Tumblr is where people in my fandom's post and is somehow the most bearable social media I've used. Over time social media has become opressively "stay on this site for as long as humanly possible. we don't care what it takes". It's suffocating and sucks ass. Billionaires are out here making shit decisions for the sole purpose of profit and I hate it. Even more recently, the constant prevalance of AI generated content is making me want to stay offline forever and that's saying something. The internet at large isn't fun but Neocities and the small web is a beacon of hope of how things were, and how things could be again.</p>
                <p>This site is mainly going to consist of my writing (fanfiction, opinions on topics, raving about my interests), projects I've done, and shrines for my interests. It's ever evolving since I can never stick to a theme or layout for long so expect complete site overhauls every now and then. I hope you enjoy what you find here :)</p>

                <h2>design philosophy</h2>
                <div><i class="nf nf-oct-x"></i></div>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>I think I'm physically incapable of sticking to a site theme but nth times the charm? I lose interest in a design very quickly. I don't know if thats just me having spent too long looking at them or a need to things to be perfect but it is what it is. As such, site theme is almost guaranteed to change on a somewhat regular basis. I tend to lean towards total site overhauls because I don't like making things easy for mayself apparently so fair warning for that.</p>
                <p>My main issue is having a general theme that I enjoy looking at but more importantly enjoy editing. For me this means some level of modularity to make things a bit easier for myself. I see a lot of sites that have different layouts for every single page and while I absolutley love navigating through and reading through those pages I personally could not survive having to maintain that so props to anyone who does. I am happy and content with my one css sheet with only minor style differences for certain pages. I don't want to have a crisis everytime I make a new page because I don't know how to theme or customise it (It took me several days to settle on the current background image). I find joy in organisation. But then we run into the problem of "does this look too generic or corporate" which I hate. I don't want artifical quirkiness so to speak but I also don't want to be boring. TL;DR: I'm trying to keep it modular, but not too boring, but not too artifical either. A very fine line to walk but fuck it we ball.</p>
                <p>General goals for this site in general are to follow accessibility guidelines as best as I can because it's important for anyone to be able to use and access the small web and feel welcome. I want to have no javascript where possible (with some exceptions because webrings and embeded music players on websites are fun), and I want this site to be useable on mobile so help me god.</p>
