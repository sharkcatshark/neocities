                <p>finding comfort in relating to animals over humans and it feels more correct to view myself as non-human</p>
                <p>not fully otherkin or therian</p>
                <p>While looking through some alterhumanity sites, resources, and posts, I have found some terms<sup>*</sup> that I find myself relating to:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Copinglink:</b> A voluntary identity with or as a nonhuman or fictional entity in order to cope with stress, trauma, mental illness, or something else.</li>
                    <li><b>Otherhearted/Kith/Synpath:</b> Having a strong connection to a species, as opposed to identifying as one.</li>
                    <li><b>Kin For Fun (KFF):</b> Describes those who voluntarily identify as otherkin for fun.</li>
                </ul>
                </blockquote>
                <p>probably related to being trans and aroace</p>
                <p>I have my pronouns listed on here and Tumblr that I use he/it but no one has ever used 'it' for me so I don't know 100% how accurate that is. This one time, one my friends sent a message that was phrased in a way where it could've been referring to me with it/its pronouns and the amount of joy I got from that small misreading was something else. I have it screenshotted and everything. 'Leave <em>it</em> alone'</p>
                <p>enjoy wearing a tail. would enjoy having a real tail. that one keith fic where he got a tail prosthetic</p>
                <p>the furry to whatever this shit is pipeline</p>
                <p>dont understand why humans are seen as so seperate from animals in the first place</p>
                <p>why cats? dunno just vibes. i recongise that therians tend to drift towards either cats or dogs and im just following that pattern but fuck it why not</p>

                <p>I am so disconnected from reality to the point where I don’t want to be human anymore  (or feel human all that much). I’ve looked into therian and otherkin concepts and I can kind of relate to them? I wouldn’t call myself a therian or anything like that more that I find comfort in relating to animals more than humans and it feels more correct to view myself living an animal life.</p>
                <p>And those all essentially match what I’m experiencing. I don’t think I’m an animal stuck in a human body or think I had a past life as an animal or any of the other explanations that therians and otherkin use to explain their own experiences. I just think I would be better off mentally if I was just a little wild cat wondering around a forest instead of having to be human and do human things. I am just a little guy forced to be human against my will.</p>
                <p>I think this is also why I like it/its pronouns (not exclusively because I would never be taken seriously and he/him is a vibe). I am just a thing, a creature, something so grotesque you can’t even tell what it is. And it/its pronouns in general are so fucking cool. The <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/it">definition</a> of ‘it’ is:</p>
                <blockquote>Used to refer to that one previously mentioned. Used of a nonhuman entity; an animate being whose sex is unspecified, unknown, or irrelevant; a group of objects or individuals; an action; or an abstraction.</blockquote>
                <p>At what point in human history did we decide that gendered pronouns were needed. At what point did we decide that humanity was more important than animals that we needed to distinguish ourselves from them. What makes humans so different. I don’t think that humans are better or superior than animals, I truly don’t. We are all equal. Just because we up and decided that we are morally superior to all animals in existence so many animals end up suffering and end up stigmatised to hell and back because of it. If someones pet snake got loose suddenly people are calling for the banning of all snakes but you don’t see the same reaction for dogs. If a shark bit and killed someone then we need to start fearing for our lives and all sharks are dangerous and they need to be eradicated. Motherfucker, you choose to swim in the ocean. Thats its fucking home. You choose to accept the risks. Humans are not aquatic beings. And even pets such as dogs can be treated like shit. If a dog bit someone hard enough to cause harm for whatever reason, then people start saying that the dogs need to be put down because its a “danger to society”. The dog was acting on instinct. Chances are it was because of humans that made it aggressive. Why does the dog have to suffer for humanities mistakes? Who decided that? Why are human lives more important.<p>
                <p>This was just a long tangent to explain why I like it/its pronouns. They remove all fucked up aspects of humanity. Its grounding for me. I am not part of this collective. I am my own thing. I am willingly aligning myself with animals because it makes sense. Humans are animals so why not embrace that? And what is “being human” anyway? Just belonging to the species homo sapiens? Our ability to use cognitive thinking? That we have opposable thumbs? That we can experience love? Having love be a reason we are human is complete bullshit by the way. Dogs can love, cats can love. And if we’re talking about romantic love then just fuck all aromantic people I guess. And asexuals by association.<p>
                <blockquote>“Romantic love does not make someone human” – Aromantics as a whole.</blockquote>
                <p>One of my online, not so much anymore, “friends” said recently that, to vaguely quote: “Being gay and/or trans is a mental illness. Not in a homophobic way but a scientific way because it doesn’t make sense in terms of how life is created or for someone to feel like they’re something else.” First of fucking all: <em>Heavy</em> disagree to just all of that. Yes, being gay/trans is a mental thing but that doesn’t mean its not a correct way of being. I get where they were coming from but saying things like that just invites bigots to justify why all queer people should be killed off. We shouldn’t be holding ourselves to heteronormative concepts. The point of existence is to be happy with yourself and what you do.</p>
                <p>I’m trying to figure out why I may be feeling all of this. Feeling disconnected from humanity. And I think it’s partly because I’m trans. Being trans is a lot to deal with on a good day let alone trying to deal with transitioning while everyone else is going on with their lives around you. You feel stunted from your peers. You have to come out to everyone you already know, come out to everyone you don’t know because you don’t pass the way you want to, medically transitioning, legal shit, etc, etc. Its so much to deal with at once and you have no choice but to deal with it because being trans isn’t something you can just hide form everyone else, you <em>have</em> to tell people. So I think that all of this is making me feel overwhelmed and not want to be human because if I was just a cat or something I wouldn’t have to deal with all this and I could just live a painless existence just existing without having to factor 50 things into my life that others don’t.<p>
