                <p>Fuck! The! Governement!</p>
                <p>The tl;dr of anarchism is that hierarchies are bad and should be abolished. The main hierarchies being governments and capitalism. Us anarchists believe that we don't need a government for society to function and that we can self-govern just fine.</p>
                <p>The only reason why governments have power is because they declared that they do and killed anyone who said otherwise. They are not a natural thing. They are not a fact of life. They are not necessary. If everyone woke up tomorrow and decided that governmental structures needed to go, collectively we could make it happen. There is nothing stopping us. Humans existed for hundreds and thousands of years without government just fine until uh oh a select few got power hungry and now we have capitalism and what should not be called democracy.</p>
                <p>Everyday I wake up and struggle to understand how people will look at the state of the world and think "yeah this is a good system". The thing is though, that most people don't think that and they do actually have complaints against capitalism but the second you bring up how what they're upset at is capitalism suddenly you're being stupid and don't understand how the world works. Like look me in the eye and tell me that capitalism is a successful system.</p>
                <p>Listen to the <a href="">Money Game</a> series by Ren on YouTube.</p>
                <p>instead people willfully refuse to accept that there could be a different way to structure society because that would mean admitting their personal views and the system they have lived under for thousands of years is in fact bullshit</p>
                <p>centrism only benefits the conservative upper class, there can be no compromise between an unjust system and its unwilling workers</p>

                <p>everything is political it does not matter if we think it should be or not. for example: my mere existence as a trans person is political. it fycking shouldnt be but it is (lgbt issues, minorities, basic human rights) what i mean by political: issues that people like to debate that usually impact a group of peoples lives </p>

                Even in countries where police arent as, im gonna say, murderous, police are more [] than necessary. "They prevent crime" They don't they only
                deal with the aftermath and deal with it badly. Police are not trained in de-esculation or if they are they're not trained well because jesus
                christ. For a non-american example: recently here in Australia, there was a case on the news about how police tasered a 95 year old
                woman with dementia because she was holding a steak knife, and is now in end-of-life care [<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-24/new-details-revealed-about-the-aged-care-home/102388918">source</a>]. I have to re-iterate this: A 95 YEAR OLD WITH DEMENTIA WHO WAS 
                HOLDING A WALKING FRAME. Direct quote from the police: "The knife in question was a steak knife, a serrated edge knife. At the time she was tasered, she was approaching police, but it is fair to say at a slow pace. She had a walking frame, but she had a knife."
                like jesus christ yall are supposed to be brave or some shit shes an elderly woman ffs.<br>
                The only reason why crime like theft exists is because of larger societal issues. If we solve those issues I can guarantee that crime rates would
                go down. People dont not do crime because laws exist, they dont do crime because they dont have to or want to. If we removed the law saying 
                murder is illegal, people aren't going to start killing each other overnight. Overpolicing leads to more people being arrested for no reason.

            I find border abolition a really interesting subject because for the life of me I can not understand why borders need to exist in the first place.
            Nobody chooses where on Earth they are born yet because of this random placement they have to deal with the consequences of it for their entire life.
            Some countries, such as Germany, have strong passports that let them travel almost anywhere in the world (why do we have to pay for passports btw)
            but others are not so lucky and are essentially stuck where they are. People should have the right to travel whereever they want and borders only
            serve to keep systems of oppression in place as they dictate the difference between first world and third world countries. (fact check that)
